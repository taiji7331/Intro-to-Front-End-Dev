# Summary

In this exercise, youâ€™ll create a basic log in form for the Little Lemon website. The form will contain two fields; one for the username and another for the password. Both fields are required fields and must have a minimum text length of 2. The form will also contain a button to submit the form.

You will write your code in the **index.html** files in the **workspace** folder.
